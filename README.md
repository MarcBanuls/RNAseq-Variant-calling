# RNAseq-Variant-calling
Project/s where I do Variant Calling of RNAseq data.
Here I intend to add notebooks about how to do RNAseq and I would also like to gain knowledge about the variants found in different studies.
At first I will process fastq files of different studies and obtain vcf files of them to see them and practice the workflow.
Later I would like to check the results obtained at the experiment and compare it with my interpretation of the results.
